    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>Have you guys ever connected your PC to a TV with an HDMI cable? <br>
      Well, I usually do if I'd like to watch a movie or a series of videos from my bed. <br>
      Let's assume that the videos  I watch are 10-15 minutes long and there are about 5 of them. 
      I've got to a point where I've had enough of getting out of bed every time a video stops, to start a new one. <br>
      I could've just made a playlist for the videos, but to  add / delete them from the playlist would be way too tedious.<br>
      So, I decided to code something quick and easy. </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      Since, I watch a lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves">Michael Reeves</a> videos I thought to myself,
      <q>Let's just set up a web server with flask, connect to it with a phone, and send coordinates when dragging fingers
      across the screen and moving the mouse based on those coordinates.</q> <br>
      Here's a sketch of how it is going to work:</p>
      <div class="container-fluid"><img src="/images/remote-mouse-plan.png"></div>
      <p>
        Luckily for me, python had a library called <q><a href="https://pypi.org/project/mouse/">mouse</a></q> which made my job easier. <br>
        I used XMLHttpRequests on the client side, to send data to the web server. The server would then make the mouse move to the coordinates
        sent from the phone. <br>
      </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Problems with the controls</h2>
    <p>
      The problem was that if you moved your finger from the bottom of the screen, the mouse pointer would follow the exact
      coordinates and go to the bottom of the screen as well. This made the controlling a bit hard, but not unusable yet irritating. (By this point
      I've wrritten code to map the size of the phone screen to the size of the monitor).
    </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Improvements</h2>
    <p>
      The control problem was mitigated, by using <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/relacoor.htm">relative coordinates</a>.<br>
      Before the fix, I kept on sending <a href="http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Absolute_coordinates">absolute coordinates</a> to the server, as you moved your finger across the screen.
      Meaning, that the pointer on the screen will move according to the position of your finger on the phone. <br>
      I then realised that I needed to use relative coordinates, to simulate the movement of a mouse. <code>Last point to next point</code> as opposed to <code>move to (x,y)</code>. <br>
      This worked by substracting the start coordinates <code>(x1,y1)</code> from the end coordinates <code>(x2,y2)</code>.<br>
      All there was left, is to adjust the python code to move the mouse relatively.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      I also added some control features along the way; such as scrolling up and down, left and right-click and typing. <br>
      The only unusual feature is the typing. <br>
      The way it works, is that I make a javascript prompt and send the text to the server. <br>
      The python script uses the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/">keyboard</a> and os library for this. <br>
      It copies the text onto the clipboard, pastes it wherever you clicked or left the cursor, and presses enter. This feature was 
      primarily made for searching on the web, hence the <code>enter</code> key.
